### What I learned
During the development of the of this project, I had the opportunity to learn new concepts and technologies. One of the most interesting things that I learned was how to use React Suspense to manage asynchronous data loading.

In addition, I also learned how to create server and client components using the latest version of Next.js (v13.4).

### Features
- A variety of trivia questions across multiple categories
- Intuitive user interface with simple design
- Easy setup and configuration using Next.js

### Roadmap
Here are some exciting features that I plan to add to the Trivia Quiz in the future:

- **Difficulty selection**: Enable users select their preferred difficulty level for the trivia questions.
- **User authentication**: Allow users to create accounts and login to the game. Users will be able to save their scores and track their progress over time.
- **Additional categories**: Open Trivia DB API has a wide range of categories for trivia questions, and I plan to add support for more of them.
- **Improved UI/UX**: Make tweaks to the UI/UX, based on user feedback, to make the game even more enjoyable and engaging.

### Technologies
- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- Typescript
- React Suspense
